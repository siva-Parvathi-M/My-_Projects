# Machine Uptime & Fault Trend Analysis in Tableau

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing manufacturing machine performance using Tableau. By visualizing **machine uptime, downtime**, and **hourly fault trends**, we aim to uncover patterns that impact operational efficiency on the factory floor.

Using a dataset containing timestamped logs for multiple machines, the dashboard highlights when and how frequently machines are experiencing faults and how it affects their overall performance.

## Dataset Features

The dataset contains the following columns:

| Column Name     | Description                               |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `MachineID`      | Unique identifier for each machine         |
| `CycleTime`      | Time taken to complete one production cycle |
| `Temperature`    | Recorded machine temperature               |
| `Pressure`       | Pressure reading at a given time           |
| `Fault`          | 1 = Fault occurred, 0 = No fault           |
| `Timestamp`      | Date and time of the event recorded        |

## Key Visualizations

1. **Uptime vs Downtime per Machine per Day**  
   - Shows how long each machine was running vs. down on a daily basis.

2. **Hourly Fault Trend**  
   - Highlights the number of faults that occur during each hour of the day.

3. *(Optional additional insights can be added based on dataset)*

---

## Insights Derived

- Identification of machines with the highest fault rates.
- Pinpoint hours in the day with increased fault frequency.
- Overall machine efficiency trends across days and shifts.

---

## Tools Used

- **Tableau Public** – for interactive dashboard creation.
- **Microsoft Excel / CSV** – for source data formatting and preparation.

# Data Workflow Automation using Python & GenAI

This project automates repetitive data cleaning tasks using Python and generates insightful business reports using Generative AI via Together.ai API. The dataset used is the Online Retail (2009-2010) Excel file.

# Project Overview

Goal: Automate the end-to-end data cleaning, transformation, and report generation process.

Key Components:

Automated data cleaning using pandas

Insight generation using Together.ai GenAI API

Exporting AI-generated insights to a well-formatted PDF report

# Dataset

File: Online Retail.xlsx

Sheet used: 2009-2010

Sample columns:

InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country

# How It Works

Data Cleaning

Remove null values

Drop duplicates

Filter rows with invalid quantities or prices

Insight Generation using GenAI

Group data (e.g., top-selling products, monthly revenue)

Send summaries to Together.ai’s chat completion endpoint

Receive narrative insights back from the GenAI model

PDF Report Creation

Uses fpdf2 and DejaVuSans.ttf for full UTF-8 support

Structure:

Title

Section-wise narrative insights (from GenAI)

# API Key Setup

This project uses Together.ai API.

Set your API key inside the notebook like this:

api_key = "your_together_ai_api_key_here"

# Requirements

Install all required packages:

pip install pandas fpdf2 requests openpyxl

# Output

genai_report.pdf: Final report with cleaned data insights generated by GenAI

# Future Improvements

Schedule the notebook using Colab + Google Drive

Integrate with email to send PDF reports

Add real-time alert generation for anomalies
